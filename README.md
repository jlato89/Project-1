Vanderbilt Bootcamp - Week 8 project

## User Story:

As a user I want to be abe to select the ingredients that I have and add any that are not listed.

I then want to take those ingredients and search through an API to find possible recipes that I can make.

If possible I want to see other recipes that I can almost make and where to get additional ingredients.

Target Audience: anyone who likes to or wants to cook at home.

Problem: Not knowing what recipes are possible with the food you have on hand.
